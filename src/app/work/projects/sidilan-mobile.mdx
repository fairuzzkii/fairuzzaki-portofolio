## Overview

SIDILAN (Lumajang Trade and Industry Information System) for digitalizing UMKM information and licensing services.

I was involved in developing the Reports, Partnerships, and Notifications features on the mobile side, focusing on consuming the REST API available on the SIDILAN website. The main challenge was the lack of API documentation, requiring independent exploration and customization of the endpoints. The application was built using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) state management pattern and designed from the ground up with a clean, scalable architecture, including the implementation of REST API integration.
## Technologies Used

- **Flutter & Dart** – For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Laravel** – For backend development and RESTful API implementation.
- **MySQL** – For managing and storing application data on the backend..
