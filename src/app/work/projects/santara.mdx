## Overview
SANTARA (Sistem Aplikasi Inovasi Digital Revitalisasi Budaya Lokal) is a digital platform dedicated to preserving and revitalizing the rich cultural heritage of Jember. The application integrates traditional activities, such as Grebek Budaya Kampung, into a modern digital ecosystem. It features cultural event documentation, community profiles, digital arts archives, and interactive spaces for community participation—bridging the gap between ancestral traditions and the digital generation.

Developed as a collaborative project between students and lecturers from the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Jember, SANTARA serves as a research-backed solution to the decline of local cultural documentation. By digitizing cultural assets, the app ensures that Jember’s unique "Pendalungan" identity remains accessible, sustainable, and engaging for younger audiences.

In this project, I acted as a core developer within a team, working closely under the guidance of faculty experts to ensure the platform meets both technical excellence and cultural preservation standards. We utilized an iterative development approach to build a responsive interface that simplifies how users discover and interact with local rituals, arts, and community wisdom.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter & Dart** – For developing a seamless and responsive cross-platform mobile experience.
- **Laravel** – Used as the robust backend framework to manage cultural data and API integrations.
- **MySQL** – For structured and scalable database management of cultural archives and user information.
- **Figma** – For designing an intuitive UI/UX that balances modern aesthetics with traditional cultural elements.
