## Overview

I improved the image URL handling mechanism because images were not displayed in the initial implementation. The solution implemented was to create a helper method to validate and dynamically generate image URLs, both for images with absolute URLs and relative paths from the backend. This allows all tourism content, such as news, culinary delights, events, and destinations, to be displayed correctly and consistently in the mobile application.


## Technologies Used

- **Flutter & Dart** – For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Laravel** – For backend development and RESTful API implementation.
- **MySQL** – For managing and storing application data on the backend.
