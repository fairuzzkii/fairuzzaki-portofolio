## Overview

Sakti Pos is a financial accounting application designed to simplify the recording and management of daily transactions.

In developing this application, I focused on slicing the design into Flutter to build the front-end, while also preparing state management using the BLoC pattern. I worked on several key features, including adding items, sales returns, and reports, as well as making improvements and refinements to various UI displays to make them more presentable, consistent, and user-friendly.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter & Dart** – For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Code Igniter** – For backend development and RESTful API implementation.
- **MySQL** – For managing and storing application data on the backend..
