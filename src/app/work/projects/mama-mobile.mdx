## Overview

Mascitra Internship Activity & Attendance Application.

In developing this application, I added an Agreement Letter feature, as well as developing the backend in the form of an Agreement API Controller and API Route.

ge patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.
