## Overview

Proud to share the completion of TheraMind, a mobile-based mental health application designed to help users manage emotional well-being through AI journaling, mood tracking, and access to professional support. The app focuses on promoting mental health awareness and providing an accessible, stigma-free platform for users in need.

As the UI/UX Designer, I was responsible for crafting the overall look and feel of the application using Figma for wireframing and prototyping, and Canva for visual asset creation and presentation. I focused on building intuitive user flows, empathetic interfaces, and a calming visual design that supports user comfort and engagement.

By applying user-centered design principles and consistent iteration, the final prototype provides a seamless and supportive experience that empowers individuals to take better control of their mental health journey.

## Technologies Used
