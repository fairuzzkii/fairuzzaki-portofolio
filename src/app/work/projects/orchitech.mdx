## Overview

Excited to share OrchiTech, an IoT-driven mobile application built to assist orchid growers in automating the monitoring and control of temperature, humidity, and watering schedules. The system integrates sensors and actuators via ESP32 microcontrollers, connected to a real-time database and a mobile app interface for seamless remote management.

As the Project Manager, I was responsible for overseeing the end-to-end development process, from initial planning and scope definition to sprint coordination and team communication. I ensured the team adhered to the Agile Scrum methodology, managed timelines, facilitated sprint reviews, and kept all deliverables aligned with user needs and technical feasibility.

With features like environmental tracking, automated fan and watering control, manual overrides, and activity logs, OrchiTech improves cultivation efficiency and plant health while reducing manual workload. This project demonstrates how IoT and mobile technologies can drive innovation in agriculture and smart farming practices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter & Dart** – For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Supabase** – For managing and storing application data on the backend.
- **MQTT** – Communication.
