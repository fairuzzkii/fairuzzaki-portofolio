## Overview

Arise is a gamification-based health and workout application designed to make workout activities more engaging, structured, and enjoyable. By incorporating game elements like levels, achievements, and challenges, the app helps users maintain their enthusiasm for regular exercise while staying consistent with their fitness goals.

Throughout the project, we encountered challenges in implementing seamless user interaction and integrating game mechanics with health-tracking features. However, through persistent effort, collaboration, and innovation, we managed to create a solution that blends functionality with fun.
