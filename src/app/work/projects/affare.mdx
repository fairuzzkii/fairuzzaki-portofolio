## Overview

Affare, a web-based platform developed to connect students with internship and part-time job opportunities, supporting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. This project aims to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry needs by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform for job-seeking and recruitment.

As the UI/UX Designer and Front-End Developer, I was responsible for designing intuitive, accessible, and responsive user interfaces while implementing them using Laravel Blade templates. I focused on delivering a seamless user experience for both applicants and employers, ensuring the platform not only looked clean and modern but also functioned efficiently across devices.

Through teamwork, problem-solving, and continuous iteration, we successfully built a solution that supports youth employability and promotes inclusive economic growth through digital innovation.
