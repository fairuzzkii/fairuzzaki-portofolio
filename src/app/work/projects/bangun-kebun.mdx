## Overview

Proud to introduce Bangun Kebun, a mobile application designed to empower households in achieving food security through urban farming and digital collaboration. The app provides integrated features such as agricultural articles and tutorials, an AI-powered farming chatbot, an interactive community forum, and an e-commerce platform for agricultural products—helping users learn, cultivate, and market their harvest sustainably.

As the UI/UX Designer & Front-End Developer, I designed user-friendly interfaces using Figma and implemented them with Flutter (Dart) and Provider for responsive, cross-platform performance. I also contributed to ensuring seamless integration with back-end services built on ASP .Net Core and PostgreSQL.

This project was developed using the Agile Scrum methodology, enabling our team to adapt iteratively based on user feedback and testing. Bangun Kebun was recognized as a Top 5 Finalist & 2nd Runner Up at the FIT Competition 2025, a national mobile application contest. The project not only addresses food insecurity and price volatility but also contributes to sustainable living and community empowerment through digital innovation.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter & Dart** – For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **ASP .NET** – For backend development and RESTful API implementation.
