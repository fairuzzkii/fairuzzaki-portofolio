## Overview

✍ Ngupy: Coffee Collector System Service Project 👨‍💻

Hello everyone 👋, me and my team have successfully completed the Ngupy service project.

Ngupy is an application designed to simplify and streamline coffee transactions between farmers and collectors in Sidomulyo Village. Despite facing several challenges during feature development, we overcame them through strong collaboration and teamwork.

For this project, we used C# as the primary programming language, developed the application using Visual Studio, and utilized MySQL as the database to ensure a robust and efficient system.

We are grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and look forward to collaborating on more innovative and impactful systems in the future!
