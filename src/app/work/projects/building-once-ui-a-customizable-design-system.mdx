## Overview

I have completed my internship as a Mobile Developer at PT Mascitra Teknologi Indonesia (Mascitra.com). This internship provided me with valuable hands-on experience by allowing me to directly contribute to real-world mobile application development in a professional environment.

Throughout the internship, I worked on several mobile projects, starting from UI slicing from Figma to Flutter, implementing BLoC state management, and integrating RESTful APIs using a clean and scalable architecture. I was involved in developing and enhancing key features across multiple applications, including SIDILAN Mobile, SaktiPos Mobile, Mama Mobile, and Lumajang Tourism app.

These projects strengthened my understanding of how to build maintainable, reusable, and well-structured mobile applications, while also emphasizing the importance of teamwork and collaboration through a structured Git workflow. This experience helped me realize that software development in the industry goes beyond coding it requires clear communication, adaptability, and effective problem-solving.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the mentors and the entire team at Mascitra for their guidance, support, and constructive feedback throughout the internship. This experience has been a meaningful milestone in my professional growth and will serve as a strong foundation for my future career.

Learning again, learning first, learning continuously 🚀

## Key Features

- **UI Slicing from Figma to Flutter:** Implemented pixel-perfect UI from Figma designs with responsive layouts and reusable components for mobile applications.
- **BLoC State Management Implementation:** Applied BLoC pattern to manage application states in SIDILAN and SaktiPos Mobile, ensuring scalable and maintainable code structure.
- **REST API Integration:** Integrated backend services into mobile apps, consuming APIs for reports, partnerships, notifications, and agreement data.
- **Backend API Development:** Built Agreement API Controller and RESTful routes to manage internship agreement data and support mobile integration.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter & Dart** – For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Laravel** – For backend development and RESTful API implementation.
- **MySQL** – For managing and storing application data on the backend.
- **Figma** – For UI/UX design and interface slicing reference.
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and collaborative development workflow.
- **RESTful API** – For communication between mobile applications and backend services.
- **Postman** – For testing and validating API endpoints during development.
- **Laragon** – For local development environment and backend server setup.
- **ClickUp** – For task management, project tracking, and team collaboration.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was working with undocumented APIs in the SIDILAN project, which required exploring endpoints independently and adjusting integration logic. Additionally, ensuring UI consistency and improving existing features across multiple applications required adaptability and collaboration with the team.
Through these challenges, I learned the importance of clean architecture, structured state management, effective debugging, and clear communication in professional software development environments.

## Outcome
The internship resulted in multiple functional features and improvements across several production-level applications, including SIDILAN Mobile, SaktiPos Mobile, Mama Mobile, and Lumajang Tourism. This experience significantly improved my technical expertise in Flutter, API integration, and software architecture, while also strengthening my teamwork and professional problem-solving skills in an industry environment.
