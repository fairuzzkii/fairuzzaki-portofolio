## Overview

Proud to introduce J-TOUR, a location-based tourism application that helps travelers explore destinations in Jember with ease. The app delivers integrated features such as destination search, category filtering, real-time maps, user reviews, weather forecasts, and favorite-saving options—enhancing the digital tourism experience for both visitors and locals.

As the UI/UX Designer, I designed intuitive, user-centered interfaces using Figma and implemented them with Flutter (Dart) to ensure a responsive and seamless user experience. 

I also took full responsibility as the Front-End and Back-End Developer, managing data flow with Firebase and building RESTful APIs using Express.js for admin-side functionality such as destination management, updates, and user review moderation.

This project was developed using the Agile Scrum methodology, allowing our team to adapt iteratively based on feedback and testing. J-TOUR not only serves as a solution to fragmented tourism information in the region, but also contributes to inclusive and sustainable tourism growth through thoughtful design and scalable technology.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter & Dart** – For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Express.js** – For backend development and RESTful API implementation.
- **Firebase** – For managing and storing application data on the backend.
